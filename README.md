## Description

This project tests my Data Science and Machine Learning skills using a [car dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zafarali27/car-price-prediction/data). The main goal is to answer pricing-related questions posed by the dataset, assess its quality, and evaluate how useful it can be for building predictive models.

## Introduction

In Machine Learning and A.I., the effective use of data handling and modeling is crucial. A well-structured approach to these steps can lead to impressive results.

This project explores how various features, such as price, model, condition, mileage, engine size, and year, influence car prices. Through this exercise, I aim to:
- Build predictive models using the data.
- Answer key questions about car pricing trends.
- Test the quality and usability of the dataset.

**Analysis so far:**
- Data exploration is pending and will be updated.
