# Car Price Modeling and Analysis

## Description

This project is about testing my Data Science and Machine Learning skills through a Kaggle data set [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zafarali27/car-price-prediction/data]. The main goal is to answer questions posed on Kaggle and assess how good the dataframe is and how usable it can be for users.

## Introduction

In Machine Learning and A.I., the effective use of data handling and modeling is crucial. A well-structured approach to these steps can lead to impressive results.

This project explores how various features, such as price, model, condition, mileage, engine size, and year, influence car prices. Through this exercise, I aim to:
- Build predictive models using the data.
- Answer key questions about car pricing trends.
- Test the quality and usability of the dataset.

Some features in the dataset include: Price, Model, Condition, Mileage, Engine Size, and Year.

**Analysis so far:**
- Data exploration is pending and will be updated.
